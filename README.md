A.I.M.-Y (Autonomous Insurgent Machine -You), is an autonomous robotic system that was built in a span of 15 days as part of the Thales Arduino Microcontroller Challenge-2016. The robot identifies and tracks a pre-processed image that comes under its camera's field of view using Computer Vision algoirthm and aims at the identified target using LASER gun mounted on a 2-axis servo motors that are controlled by Arduino Uno microcontroller. The robot moves around by itself with the help of DC motors mounted to the base frame which is controlled by the same controller. Video Link: https://goo.gl/SvvOlQ
